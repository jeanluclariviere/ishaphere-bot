__**Time and Seasons**__
Almost everyone in Ishaphere does something to mark the passage of days, seasons, and years. The aze'ian soltice is treasured by the elves of Feyhurst, whereas the Goblins record songs to count the days and remember the passing of their formidable chieftains.

**Seasons**
Ishaphere is in a perpetual state of winter. Its three seasons, irh, cal, and aze, are distinguished by milder or more cold temperatures, respectively, and are home to more than a dozen different types of snowfall that indicate the seasonal shifts between them throughout the year. The land itself is mostly desolate, with isolated pockets of civilization scattered around the countryside, swallowed by dense coniferous forests. 

**Day and Night**
Ishaphere has 24-hour days that are divided into three parts. The sun rises and sets during the first 8 hours of Midday, while the moon rises and sets during Twilight. Midnight sees Ishaphere plunged into darkness, with only the stars and the occasional Andarian Contraction visible.

**The Hours of the Day**
It is typical for locals to wake with the sun at Midday and labor until dusk, when the moon rises and hovers low in the sky. Meals are eaten as the moon starts to set, a time known as Nightfall, when the day settles, and the temperatures drop. The final few hours of light are allocated for prayers before families gather together for warmth in a common room, located at the heart of the house known as a hollow.

**Marking the Years**
The Andarian calendar has 12 months, each lasting precisely 24 days. Each month is divided into three weeks, each of which lasts eight days, for a total of 288 days in a year. The seasons of irh, cal, and aze last four months and are historically marked by a variety of celebrations.
