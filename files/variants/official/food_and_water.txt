__**Food and Water (dmg p. 111)**__
**Food**
A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by
subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day
without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her
Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a
character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating
reduces the number of days without food by one (until zero is reached).

**Water**
A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the
weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of
the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level
of exhaustion at the end of the day.
If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes
two levels in either case.
