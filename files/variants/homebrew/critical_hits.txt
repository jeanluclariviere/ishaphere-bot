__**Critical Hits**__
Roll damage normally, then tally the maximum possible from the damage dice and add this to your damage. 

e.g. If a rogue regularly deals 1d4+1d6+3 damage, a critical hit would do the following, 1d4+1d6+4+6+3. The +4 corresponds to the d4 maximum, the +6 correspond to the d6 maximum.
