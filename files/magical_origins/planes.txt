__**The Planes**__
The Planes were born one after the other, each giving birth to a Goddess more powerful than the last. They are superimposed one on top of the other, resulting in all objects, inanimate or living, being bound to each plane.

**Inner Plane**
First came Oanh and the Inner Plane; born from void, calcified by death. In order to die, one must be bound to this plane.

**Material Plane**
Second came Andar, the Material Plane, and life. In order to interact with the pysical world, one must be bound to this plane.

**Celestial Plane**
Third came Ihris and the Celestial Plane, whose existence was fueled by the Material Plane's piety. In order to have free will, one must be bound to this plane.

**Outer Plane**
Fourth came Udiel and the Outer Plane, whose chaos is caused by entropy, destroying all order. In order to use magic, one must be bound to this plane.
