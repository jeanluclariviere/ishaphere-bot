__**Secret Lore**__
**Tomes of Knowledge**
An eccentric wizard is said to have assembled the Tomes of Knowledge, a collection of specialized books, many years ago. The authors of this collection come from all over the land, and cover a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to, history, alchemy, and cooking. People who read these pages claim that they have gained abilities that they wouldn't have otherwise had access to, such as increased physical and mental ability, stamina, and concentration!

**The Children**
Folklore warns against burning a fire in the dead of night because it will beckon the Children. Their lovely voices may be heard singing in the distance before they strike mercilessly, killing everyone.

**Dragon Prison**
Ceros, an ancient white dragon, lives in the heart of Ems Depth. He has waited patiently since the dawn of the last ice age for warmer conditions to release him. As long as he remains aware, no one has been able to approach him. His snout is visible through the heavy ice cover and acts as a caution to those crossing the ocean.
