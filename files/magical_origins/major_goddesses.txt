__**Major Goddesses**__

__**Udiel**__
**Domain**: Chaos
**Plane**: Outer
**Symbol**: Spiraling Blackhole
**Portfolio**: Rat, Rooster, Opossum
**Dogma:** Magic may be dissected and broken down to its simplest elements through study and meditation. Spread the usage and understanding of magic by teaching and disseminating magic artifacts across the world. Don't keep your wonderful secrets to yourself, and don't be afraid to express yourself in every manner possible.


__**Ihris**__
**Domain**: Trickery
**Plane**: Celestial
**Symbol**: Jesters hat
**Portfolio**: Locust, Ox, Snake
**Dogma:** Never reveal your true intentions, as this is a sign of weakness that will only serve to ruin you. Worship Ihris blindly, for she will shield you from the truth. Let her be your champion, for you are but a fool. Do not think yourself above retribution. Dismiss other faiths as false prophets and demagogues.

__**Andar**__
**Domain**: Winter
**Plane**: Material
**Symbol**: Half-moon on its back, with snow falling.
**Portfolio**: Vulture, Swine, Crow
**Dogma:** This unending cycle of birth and death gives life its meaning, and Winter is at the center of it all. It's okay to embrace the cold while huddling together for warmth. Be respectful to all living creatures. Those who are dying should not be hindered in the process; instead, constantly show compassion to those who are vulnerable.

__**Oanh**__
**Domain**: Death
**Plane**: Inner
**Symbol**: Animal Skull
**Portfolio**: Cockroach, Goat, Weasel
**Dogma:** There is only one master, and that is Oahn. Defy her and die â€” or discover allegiance to her in death because she will compel it. Since genuine power can only be earned by serving Oahn, listen to the words of her highest-ranking clerics. Frighten people with stories of Oahn.
