Ishaphere's largest postal employees' union, Continental Post, represents postal workers in all six territories. To get mail and parcels around the continent, they have to withstand the harsh winter conditions on a daily basis. Their private expressways are a highly prized secret that allows them to cut their travel times approximately in half. 

Drivers need to provide their own sled, cats, and equipment to join their order, which is notorious for its rigorous admittance exams.
