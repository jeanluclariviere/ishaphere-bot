Beginning as a tiny adventuring company in the Koral Wastes, this now-famous band of Lizardfolk is notorious for patrolling the highways, protecting those willing to pay and wreaking havoc on  those who won't.

To avoid problems, the majority of merchant enterprises and caravans have long-standing contracts with them, while smaller companies avoid them by seeking alternate ways to and from the east.
