These wild, gallivanting explorers, dubbed "keepers of peace," are well-known for their charitable deeds and their quest for hidden riches in ancient cavern towns. Their organization consists of multiple chapters in different major cities across the territories, regularly accepting new members into their ranks, but only on one condition. As a member of the corp, one must swear an oath to help all those in need, regardless of whether they are able to pay their dues in coin or not.
