__**Cherry Coats**__
**Colors:** Crimson
**Emblem:** Acorn

These Cherry Hill Woods entrepreneurs are distinguished by their crimson coats. Responsible for the majority of trade to and from Leefside and Feyhurst, smaller merchants frequently pass under the protection of their conglomerate for a modest fee. The Cherry Coats are one of the few merchant companies that can function throughout the severe aze season, and so are heavily relied on by commerce between the two territories.
