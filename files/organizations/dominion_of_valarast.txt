The Vallarasts are one of Feyhurst's longest lived, and most powerful Elven families. It is believed that their fortunes originated during the First War, smuggling weapons to anybody willing to pay. Some speculate they dabbled in magics, in the form of enchantments, though this has never proven. Later, they helped found many of the cities that exist today, securing their position of power by taxing farms and land and exacting fees from those wishing to hunt or forage.
